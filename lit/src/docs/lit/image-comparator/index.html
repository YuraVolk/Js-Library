				The purpose of the image comparator component is to create a visual comparison between two images. The current implementation
				supports comparing an arbitrary amount of images as demonstrated in the widget below. The base requirement to compare images is to
				make images absolute positioned and occupy auto width and height. The component allows users to slide a comparison slider
				horizontally to reveal different portions of the two images. The component is built using. It includes CSS styles for positioning
				and styling the comparison slider. The component dynamically adjusts the width of the images and the position of the slider based on
				user interaction. It also handles mouse and pointer events for smooth sliding functionality. The component only gives basic styling,
				such as a relative wrapper element and required interactions. Other than that, you can achieve full customization only through
				experimenting with CSS properties.
