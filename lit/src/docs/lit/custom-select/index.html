      The custom select component represents a styled select element. Since normally select element cannot be styled
      across all browsers in the same way, it may be required to use a JavaScript solution to achieve single design.
      This select works through hiding original select component and substituting it with other components that under
      the hood change the select's values. All you need to do to use this component is to pass a valid select element
      as the children. To style in a customized way, inherit the component in your own subclass and give custom styles.
      Normally it shouldn't be required to change behavior logic.
