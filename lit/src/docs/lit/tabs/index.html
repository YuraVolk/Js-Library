				The tabs component is a quite popular component that allows to view multiple panes of content out of which only one is visible
				initially. This component encapsulates away the animation logic, automatically applying the click listeners and animation classes in
				order to allow for creating more complex tabs animations, like the one demonstrated here. This component accepts two slotted
				children: a slot with name "headers", for tab headers parent, and a slot with name "tabs", for the tabs parent. Additionally this
				component may accept the following props:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>currentTab, a number that specifies the default visible tab index, defaults to 0. Use this prop to change the visible tab.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here you can see an example of default component settings with external CSS styling:</p>
			<tabs-application-example-1></tabs-application-example-1>
			<p>
				In order to correctly configure the animation and make sure it is easy to extend, the tab class wraps around a transition class. It
				applies the following set of classes:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>enter-active, when the appearing animation is about to start.</li>
				<li>enter, when the appearing animation has started.</li>
				<li>enter-done, when the appearing animation has finished.</li>
				<li>leave-active, when the leaving animation is about to start.</li>
				<li>leave, when the leaving animation has started.</li>
				<li>leave-done, when the leaving animation has finished.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				You need to query the element, either through a ref or just through a plain querying, and extract the provided transitionDirective
				and apply it to the class attribute of the element you want to animate: the transition will automatically get in sync through its
				own semaphore-based asynchronous data management, making sure that only on data change the transitions will get started.
			</p>
