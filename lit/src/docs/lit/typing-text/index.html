			<p>
				The typing text, or typewriter text effect is an interesting effect to add to your website. This component represents a visually
				appealing self-typing text effect that firstly erases any existing text and then types the new text. Through configuration options
				you may tweak the default settings and even apply animation to the text. You need to pass the instances as the pre elements, as only
				pre elements are considered valid text here.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>strings, specifies the phrase list, with semicolon separated sentences. Empty by default.</li>
				<li>repetitions, allows you to repeat and cycle through phrases by the number specified. Defaults to 1.</li>
				<li>interval, sets the initial delay and interval between the text animation.</li>
				<li>typingSpeed, sets the speed at which letters are typed in milliseconds, defaults to 35.</li>
				<li>unTypingSpeed, an optional number that sets the speed at which letters are deleted in milliseconds, defaults to 35.</li>
				<li>
					eachLesserAsSpan, allows to make each letter a separate span if needed, as such allows to create more complex animations. Disabled
					by default.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the bottom of a page you can see a typing text with external CSS styling:</p>
			<typing-text-application-example-1></typing-text-application-example-1>
			<p>And here is an animated version of this text:</p>
			<typing-text-application-example-2></typing-text-application-example-2>
