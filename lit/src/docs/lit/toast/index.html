				The toast component which represents a panel that smoothly transitions in and then smoothly transitions out is commonly used and has
				many applications: notifications, cookie requests, and et cetera. This is a very simplistic, and just gives the necessary attributes
				to quickly setup a smooth animation. The basic configuration is to insert all required content inside the component. This component
				accepts the following props:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>isOpen, specifies whether the toast is open.</li>
				<li>
					autoCloseDelay, a feature by default disabled that automatically closes the toast after the milliseconds passed to this attribute.
				</li>
				<li>transitionDuration, that specifies the duration of the transition.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the bottom of a page you can see a toast with external CSS styling:</p>
			<toast-application-example-1></toast-application-example-1>
			<p>
				In order to correctly configure the animation and make sure it is easy to extend, the toast class wraps around a transition class.
				It applies the following set of classes:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>enter-active, when the appearing animation is about to start.</li>
				<li>enter, when the appearing animation has started.</li>
				<li>enter-done, when the appearing animation has finished.</li>
				<li>leave-active, when the leaving animation is about to start.</li>
				<li>leave, when the leaving animation has started.</li>
				<li>leave-done, when the leaving animation has finished.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				You need to query the element, preferably through a ref, and extract the provided transitionDirective and apply it to the class
				attribute of the element you want to animate: the transition will automatically get in sync through its own semaphore-based
				asynchronous data management, making sure that only on data change the transitions will get started.
			</p>
