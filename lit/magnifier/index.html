The main configuration is created through CSS, and requires some properties to be set on image-magnifier-component: the wrap should be relative, and the glass should be absolute. Give data-magnifier-content to the image you need to magnify and data-magnifier-glass attribute for the magnifying glass, and absolute position. You can give it any style you want initially. You can configure the component with these additional properties:</p><ul><li>zoomScale: A number that defines the scale of the magnified image. The default value is 2.</li><li>autoConfigureGlassSource: A boolean that determines whether the magnifier should automatically configure the source of the magnifying glass based on the image's source. The default value is false.</li></ul>In order to magnify multiple images, you can create multiple image magnifier components. Here's an example usage:<p></p><magnifier-application-example-1></magnifier-application-example-1><p>Next, you may see a very similar implementation that is called Zooming Image, with a lot of aspects being shared with this implementation. However, there are important algorithmic differences between the two: this implementation is overall less robust and works better when magnifying glass does not appear when not hovered. The other implementation provides a fallback effect that shows an empty background when near to edge or moving from edge, while this implementation may not give such accurate results for edges. This implementation on the other hand is much better for non-rectangular glass shapes, and is overall a perfect implementation for statically visible non-rectangular glass.</p></main></body></html>
