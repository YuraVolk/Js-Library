It provides a convenient way to display content in a floating manner, allowing users to interact with it while maintaining its position on the screen. The component can be configured through CSS and offers various options to suit different design requirements.</p><ul><li>isOpen: This boolean attribute determines whether the panel is open or closed. When set to true, the panel is visible and accessible to the user. Conversely, when set to false, the panel is hidden from view.</li><li>CSS Styling: The component can be styled using CSS to match the desired design aesthetic. This includes options to define the panel's dimensions, background color, border, and other visual properties.</li><li>Positioning: The floating panel component supports two main CSS position options: fixed and sticky. When the fixed position is used, the panel remains fixed relative to the viewport, regardless of scrolling. This is useful when the panel needs to stay in a specific position on the screen, such as a sidebar or a toolbar. On the other hand, the sticky position allows the panel to stick to a specific position within its parent container as the user scrolls. This is particularly useful when the panel needs to stay within a certain section of the page, such as a header or a footer.</li></ul><p></p><floating-panel-component isopen="true"><div class="floating-panel floating-panel--fixed"><h1 class="floating-panel__caption">Fixed Floating Panel</h1><p>This panel keeps its alignment through position: fixed.
