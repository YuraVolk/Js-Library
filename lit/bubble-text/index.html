This component makes most sense with Transition Group component, which is activated through setting a duration prop and passing a render function to the component. This way one can make smooth animations with letters actually being swapped. Here's an example below that demonstrates this effect:</p><bubble-text-application-example-1></bubble-text-application-example-1><p>Here's an another example of the component, but this time with faster typing speed than transition speed:</p><bubble-text-application-example-2></bubble-text-application-example-2></main></body></html>
