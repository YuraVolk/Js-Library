Many countdowns have fixed formats, however this countdown component can be easily extended to give a custom format with minimum configuration required. If you want to use standard word-based text rendering, all you have to do is to specify the date attribute to be a real date string in the countdown-component element. The countdown can be easily customized through external CSS, thus making it very easy to configure. You must insert data-countdown property in the any countdown element within the component. Here is a working example:</p><countdown-component date="May 6, 2025 11:00:00"><p class="countdown" data-countdown></p></countdown-component></main></body></html>
