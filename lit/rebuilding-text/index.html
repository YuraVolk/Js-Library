It takes an array of strings and displays them one by one, with each string being rebuilt and revealed gradually. This component adds an interesting visual effect to your web application or website. You could think of the core logic of this effect to bridge the gap in difference between the two words through swapping the letters, bridging the middle gap between two words.</p><ol><li>Custom Element Definition: The RebuildingTextComponent class is defined as a custom element using the @customElement decorator.</li><li>Property Declarations: The class defines several properties using the @property decorator. These properties define the behavior and configuration of the Rebuilding Text Component. They include strings, repetitions, interval and typingSpeed.</li><li>Render Method: The render method is implemented to define the HTML template for the custom element. In this case, it simply renders a slot element, which allows you to insert content into the component.</li></ol><p></p><rebuilding-text-application-example-1></rebuilding-text-application-example-1><p></p><h3>Basic Usage:</h3><rebuilding-text-application-example-2></rebuilding-text-application-example-2>In this example, the Rebuilding Text Component is used to display the strings "Hello" and "World" in a swapped manner. The strings will be repeated twice with an interval of 3 seconds between repetitions. The typing speed is set to 45 characters per second. The pre element is used as the target element for displaying the rebuilt text. Here you can closely observe how the algorithm works:<rebuilding-text-application-example-3></rebuilding-text-application-example-3></main></body></html>
