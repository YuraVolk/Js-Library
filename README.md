# Js-Library

This is my JavaScript library of common scripts.
Every script may be used in project. All scripts
were created to speed up development process
without losing quality. Main aim of this
library is in providing high-quality solutions
for problems written in libraries (jQuery, loDash, et.c.).
All solutions are created with pure (vanilla) JavaScript.
