# Js-Library

This is my JavaScript library of common scripts.
The basic idea behind such a library is that a lot of scripts
that are impossible to implement without JS are highly unrelated
in implementations and libraries, which makes usage of numerous such
scripts in consistent. This library aims to provide a more consistent,
customizable solution that allows for extensive and easy component styling,
as well as a performant way of solving an issue.
All solutions are currently implemented in the following libraries and frameworks:
1. Lit, currently having all main scripts finished.
2. Vue, currently being a work-in-progress.
