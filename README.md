# Js-Library

This is a library of 25+ reusable, highly customizable scripts both in terms of styling options and in terms of the behavior, implemented in Lit, Vue and React each. This library is targeted to allow easy insertion and integration into existing projects. All scripts have maximally unified interfaces, thus allowing one to have the same configuration across frameworks, except for the framework-specific features. 

1. Lit, currently having all main scripts finished.
2. Vue, currently having all main scripts finished.
3. React, currently having all main scripts finished.
