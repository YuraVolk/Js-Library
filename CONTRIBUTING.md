## Collaborator Guildelines
In order to make notable changes, 
here are some quick tips:
- Label the issues correctly. Create a new issue for every problem. Give issues short names.
- If something in issue / pull requests looks too obscure. Give a comment to this issue mentioning author.
- If you understand issue / pull request, but others do not, edit issue.
- When creating pull request, be sure that it is working and build is starting.
- If you see wrong / duplicate issues, consider closing them adding appropriate labels.
- Consider following:
    * Issue templates
    * Pull request template
    * Security vulnerabilty format (in security policy)
